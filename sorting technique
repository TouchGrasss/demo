sor tec depends on the situation it depends on two parameter
1-time complexity - execution time of a program that means time taken for execution of program
2.space complexity - space that means space taken by the program
sorting can be performed using several techniques or methods some are 1.bubble sort ,insertion sort,selection sort,quick sort

Bubble sort
best case (time complexity) omega
worst case (time complexity) bigo
average case (time complexity) theta
time complexitiy
space complexity 
is it stable or not
approach?
inplace or not
strucutre or value
